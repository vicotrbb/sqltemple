SQLTemple is a modern, AI-powered SQL IDE built with Electron and React. It delivers a VS Code–like editing experience on top of Monaco Editor, with execution plan visualizations and AI assistance (OpenAI, Claude, or local Ollama/LM Studio) to help you write, understand, and optimize SQL faster.

## What makes SQLTemple different

- **AI everywhere:** natural language → SQL, query explanations, plan-driven optimization, and smart completions tuned to your schema across cloud (OpenAI, Claude) or local (Ollama, LM Studio) models.
- **Visualization-first:** execution plan tree with timings, table topology diagrams (Mermaid), column statistics, and relationship discovery views.
- **Designed for speed:** dark, focused UI; virtualized grids for huge result sets; background query execution; query limiting to avoid crashes.
- **Keyboard friendly:** customizable shortcuts, spotlight search across connections/objects, and multi-tab workflow.

## Who is it for?
