1. Click **⚙️ AI** in the toolbar.
2. Enter your OpenAI API key.

4. Save. AI completions, explanations, and optimizations become available in the editor and results grid.

### Tips

- Keep sensitive data out of prompts; mask customer data before sending to AI.
- For long schemas, start with a narrower context (specific schema/table) to get better completions.
