## Schema explorer

- Expand databases → schemas → tables → columns with lazy loading to handle large catalogs.
- Right-click tables for quick actions (preview, copy DDL, open in new tab).
- Hover columns to view types and basic statistics.

## Spotlight search

- Open with `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`.
- Fuzzy search across connections, schemas, tables, columns, and recent queries.
- Jump directly into an object or open it in a new tab from the search results.

## Filtering and focus

- Use search inside the explorer to narrow to table/column names.
- Collapse inactive schemas to keep the tree lightweight.
