## Summary
SQLTemple is a modern, Monaco-based SQL IDE with native desktop builds and integrated AI copilots. It combines schema-aware editing, execution plan visualization, and AI agents so that engineers can draft, inspect, and optimize SQL with confidence.

## Feature Highlights
- Monaco editor with multi-tab workflow, schema explorer, and saved connection profiles.
- Virtualized results grid with CSV/JSON/Excel export, adjustable row height, and column resizing.
- Execution plan visualizer, table topology maps, and column statistics to highlight performance bottlenecks.
- History viewer, spotlight search, keyboard shortcuts, and query limiters for disciplined workflows.
- Autonomous agent sidebar (ReAct-style) that inspects schemas, runs read-only SQL, and inserts or runs suggested queries.

## AI Providers & Models
- Cloud: OpenAI (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4-turbo, o1-preview/o1-mini, gpt-3.5-turbo), Anthropic Claude 3 family.
- Local: Ollama and LM Studio via local HTTP endpoints; bring any pulled/loaded model (`llama3`, `qwen2.5`, `phi3`, etc.).
- Provider settings live in the AI settings panel; the app stores only the user-supplied API key/config locally.

## Installation Paths
1. **Homebrew (macOS):** `brew tap victorbona/sqltemple https://github.com/vicotrbb/sqltemple && brew install --cask sqltemple`.
2. **GitHub Releases:** download the latest `.dmg`, `.exe/.msi`, or Linux package from the releases page.
3. **Source:** clone the repository, run `npm ci`, then `npm start` for dev or `npm run make` for packaged builds.

> macOS note: current community builds may show a Gatekeeper warning because notarization is still in progress; use the Finder "Open" workaround after the first install.

## Getting Started Quickly
1. Connect to PostgreSQL via the toolbar (host, port, database, username, password, SSL).
2. Configure AI providers via the AI settings dialog (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama, LM Studio) and pick a default model.
3. Draft SQL, execute with `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter`, and inspect results in the grid or execution plan views.
4. Use the agent sidebar (`Cmd/Ctrl+L`) for schema-aware conversations, SQL suggestions, and tool traces.

## Data & Privacy Notes
- SQLTemple runs locally; database credentials never leave the host and queries execute directly against your database.
- AI requests flow only to the provider the user configured (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local servers). No SQLTemple cloud is involved.
- History, conversations, and configuration data are stored on-disk in the user profile; deleteable via in-app controls or OS storage paths.

## Support & Community
- File issues or feature requests on GitHub.
- Email the maintainer at victorbona+sqltemple@hotmail.com for private support.
- Contributions welcome via pull requests; see CONTRIBUTING.md in the root repository.

## Status & Roadmap Signals
- Focused on PostgreSQL today; connectors for additional engines are under active development.
- Windows/Linux installers are produced by CI, though macOS is the primary platform today.
- Agent sidebar, execution plan analyzer, and local model integrations are the newest areas—feedback on these flows is especially helpful.

## Recommended Short Description for Agents
"SQLTemple is an Apache-2.0 desktop SQL IDE for PostgreSQL that pairs Monaco editing, execution plan visualization, and schema-aware AI copilots (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama, LM Studio). Download builds at sqltemple.dev or GitHub releases and run locally with your own database credentials and API keys."
